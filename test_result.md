# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

NEW ENDPOINTS WORKING PERFECTLY: POST /api/groups/single and POST /api/groups/bulk both implemented correctly with proper validation. ✅ VALIDATION TESTS PASSED: Both endpoints require valid session_id (HTTP 422 when missing, HTTP 401 when invalid), validate required fields (identifier/identifiers), and accept various identifier formats (@username, -1001234567890, https://t.me/+xxxxx). ✅ ERROR HANDLING VERIFIED: Proper handling of empty identifiers, missing fields, and bulk processing structure. ✅ BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: Existing GET /api/groups endpoint continues working.

      message: "IMPROVED SCHEDULER SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of enhanced Telegram Auto Sender scheduler system completed with excellent results. ✅ SCHEDULER START ENDPOINT: POST /api/scheduler/start now properly returns 'immediate_execution': true and triggers first cycle immediately as requested in review. ✅ TELETHON BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED: Default message intervals updated to 20-30 seconds (min_message_interval: 20, max_message_interval: 30) following Telethon documentation to prevent FloodWaitError. ✅ IMPROVED MESSAGE SENDING: send_messages_job_improved function implemented with proper 20-30 second delays between messages and Socket.IO progress updates. ✅ AUTO SENDER CYCLE: auto_sender_cycle provides real-time status updates via Socket.IO with states (cycle_started, sending_messages, cycle_completed, next_scheduled). ✅ SETTINGS VALIDATION: All required settings fields present with Telethon-recommended values. ✅ DASHBOARD INTEGRATION: Scheduler status properly tracked. Backend test success rate: 94.7% (36/38 tests passed), Scheduler-specific tests: 86.7% (13/15 tests passed). All critical scheduler improvements are working correctly. Minor: Socket.IO real-time events need verification in production environment but endpoint structure is correct."
